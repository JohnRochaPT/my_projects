                           Portus Cale, has been referred to as the origin of the name Portugal, based on transliteration and oral
                           evolution from Latin.

                          of fortified wine. Porto is on the Portuguese Way path of the Camino de Santiago. In 2014 and 2017, Porto was
                          elected The Best European Destination by the Best European Destinations Agency.
