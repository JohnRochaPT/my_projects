| Implement in your homepage directory a website that must:                                       |
|                                                                                                 |
| 1.- Contain at least four different .html pages, at least one of which is index.html (the main  |
|     page of your website), and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to    |
|     any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.                                         |

| 2.- Use at least ten (10) distinct HTML tags besides <html>, <head>, <body>, and <title>. Using |
|     some tag (e.g., <p>) multiple times still counts as just one (1) of those ten!              |

                          <strong>Lisbon is one of the oldest cities in the world. </strong>
                           The second-oldest European capital city (after Athens), predating other modern European capitals by centuries.
                            Settled by pre-Celtic tribes and later founded and civilized by the Phoenicians, Julius Caesar made it a municipium called
                            Felicitas Julia,[8] adding the term to the name Olissipo. After the fall of the Roman Empire, it was ruled by a series of
                            Germanic tribes from the 5th century, most notably the Visigoths. Later it was captured by the Moors in the 8th century.
                            In 1147, Afonso Henriques conquered the city and in 1255, it became Portugal's capital, replacing Coimbra.
                            It has since been the political, economic, and cultural centre of the country.
                            <br><br>
                            Lisbon is recognised as an alpha-level global city because of its importance in finance, commerce, fashion, media,
                            entertainment, arts, international trade, education, and tourism. Lisbon is amongst the two Portuguese cities (the other
                            being Porto) to be recognised as a global city, and it is also home to three companies in the Global 2000 (EDP Group,
                            Galp Energia and Jerónimo Martins). Lisbon is one of the major economic centres in Europe, with a growing financial
                            sector, with PSI-20 being part of Euronext, the largest center for debt and funds listings in the world. The Lisbon region
                            has a higher GDP PPP per capita than any other region in Portugal. Its GDP PPP amounts to US$179 billion and thus $61,713
                            per capita. The city occupies the 40th place of highest gross earnings in the world and, with almost 21,000 millionaires,
                            is the 11th European city by number of millionaires and the 14th by number of billionaires. Most of the headquarters of
                            multinational corporations in Portugal are located in the Lisbon area.

                          <strong>Richest city in Portugal.</strong>
                          The Lisbon region is the wealthiest region in Portugal and it is well above the European Union's GDP per capita average –
                          it produces 45% of the Portuguese GDP.
                          <br><br>Lisbon's economy is based primarily on the tertiary sector. Most of the headquarters of multinationals operating in
                          Portugal are concentrated in the Grande Lisboa Subregion, especially in the Oeiras municipality. The Lisbon metropolitan
                          area is heavily industrialized, especially the south bank of the Tagus river (Rio Tejo). The lisbonite industry has very
                          large sectors in oil, as refineries are found just across the Tagus, textile mills, shipyards and fishing.

                          <strong>On 1 November 1755, the city was destroyed by another devastating earthquake. </strong>
                          Eartquake killed an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Lisbon residents of a population estimated at between 200,000 and 275,000,
                           and destroyed 85 percent of the city's structures. Among several important buildings of the city, the Ribeira Palace and
                           the Hospital Real de Todos os Santos were lost. In coastal areas, such as Peniche, situated about 80 km (50 mi) north of
                           Lisbon, many people were killed by the following tsunami.
                           <br><br>By 1755, Lisbon was one of the largest cities in Europe; the catastrophic event shocked the whole of Europe and
                           left a deep impression on its collective psyche. Voltaire wrote a long poem, Poême sur le désastre de Lisbonne, shortly
                           after the quake, and mentioned it in his 1759 novel Candide (indeed, many argue that this critique of optimism was
                           inspired by that earthquake). Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. also mentions it in his 1857 poem, The Deacon's Masterpiece, or
                           The Wonderful One-Hoss Shay.
