| Implement in your homepage directory a website that must:                                       |
|                                                                                                 |
| 1.- Contain at least four different .html pages, at least one of which is index.html (the main  |
|     page of your website), and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to    |
|     any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.                                         |
|                                                                                                 |
| 2.- Use at least ten (10) distinct HTML tags besides <html>, <head>, <body>, and <title>. Using |
|     some tag (e.g., <p>) multiple times still counts as just one (1) of those ten!              |
|                                                                                                 |

                          <strong>Algarve is one of Europe's favorite summer destinations.</strong>
                          It was here that, in the 15th century, the Portuguese set off on the epic journey that led them to discover
                          other peoples and cultures… and it is in the Algarve that we cheerfully welcome many of our visitors. Even
                          the climate is mild and sunny all year round!
                          <br><br>There’s no shortage of high quality beaches either. Sandy stretches as far as the eye can see,
                          framed by golden cliffs, virtually deserted islands marking the boundary between Ria Formosa and the sea, and
                          small coves sheltered by the rocks. The ocean, in every shade of blue and mostly calm and warm, invites you for
                          long swims and to indulge in water sports.

                          <strong>The Algarve as a whole is one of the warmest places of Southern Europe.</strong>
                          With an Atlantic influenced Mediterranean climate, it has mild wet winters and warm to very hot, dry summers. It is
                          overall the sunniest region in Europe, with annual sunshine values ranging from 2600 h in the Monchique Range, to
                          values well above 3100 h on the southern coast.
                          <br><br>Generally, winter sees only subtle differences in daily maxima along the coast, mostly between 16 and 17 °C
                          (61 and 63 °F), though temperatures as high as 25 °C (77 °F) have been recorded. Conversely, overnight lows are higher
                          in the west, with Sagres and Vila do Bispo averaging 9–10 °C (48–50 °F), whilst to the east, averages are lower and
                          7–8 °C (45–46 °F) is more common. Temperatures very rarely fall below freezing (< 0 °C (32 °F)). On the interior,
                          nights are usually cooler, averaging 4–5 °C (39–41 °F).

                          <strong>In the 1960s, the Algarve became a popular destination for tourists. </strong>
                          Mainly from the United Kingdom which still is the origin of the largest group of foreigners in the
                          Algarve. It has since become a common destination for people from Spain, France, Germany, the Netherlands,
                          Ireland, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy,and the US[87] not only as tourists who visit the Algarve but also as
                          residing expats who settle in the region and buy property there. The Algarve's mild climate and hours of
                          sunshine per year have attracted interest from Portuguese and other European people wishing to have a
                          holiday home or residence in the region. Being a region of Portugal, and therefore in the European Union,
                          any EU citizen has the right to freely buy property and reside with little formality in the Algarve.
                          Algarve-based publications and newspapers are written in English specifically for this community.
                          <br><br>
                          Tourist attractions in the region include its beaches, Mediterranean climate, safety, cuisine, and
                          relatively low prices. The Algarve region has garnered international acclaim, winning the World's Leading
                          Beach Destination title twice, in 2020 and 2021, and being named Europe's Leading Beach Destination nine
                          times between 2012 and 2022, as recognized by the World Travel Awards™. Well-known beaches in the Algarve
                          include Praia da Luz, Praia da Rocha, Marinha Beach, Armação de Pêra, Praia dos Pescadores, Quarteira,
                          Vale do Lobo, Fuzeta, Barril Beach, Manta Rota and Monte Gordo. A well-known spa town is Caldas de Monchique.
                          In addition to its natural features and beaches, the Algarve has invested in the creation of a network of
                          golf courses. The Algarve is also popular for religious tourism, notably pilgrimages to the Sanctuary of
                          Our Lady of Piety (best known as the Sovereign Mother), a Marian shrine dedicated to the patron saint of
                          Loulé, that attract thousands of pilgrims of the Catholic faith to the city, or minor pilgrimages of
                          faithful Catholics to the site of putative apparitions of Our Lady Mother of Goodness which had supposedly
                          occurred in 1999 near the village of São Marcos da Serra.
