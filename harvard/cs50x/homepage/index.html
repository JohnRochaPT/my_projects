                          <strong>Portugal is a southern European country on the Iberian Peninsula.</strong>
                          Its location on the Atlantic Ocean has influenced many aspects of its culture: <code>salt cod and grilled sardines</code>
                           are national dishes, the Algarve's beaches are a major destination and much of the nation’s architecture dates to
                           the 1500s–1800s, when Portugal had a powerful maritime empire.
                           <br><br>Portuguese Colonial Empire (Império Colonial Português), was composed of the overseas colonies, factories,
                           and later overseas territories, governed by the Kingdom of Portugal, and later the Republic of Portugal.
                           It was one of the longest-lived colonial empires in European history, lasting 584 years from the conquest of
                           Ceuta in North Africa in 1415 to the transfer of sovereignty over Macau to China in 1999.
                           The empire began in the 15th century, and from the early 16th century it stretched across the globe, with bases
                           in Africa, North America, South America, and various regions of Asia and Oceania.

                          <strong>The Portuguese Empire originated at the beginning of the Age of Discovery.</strong>
                          The power and influence of the Kingdom of Portugal would eventually expand across the globe. In the wake of the
                          Reconquista, Portuguese sailors began exploring the coast of Africa and the Atlantic archipelagos in 1418–1419,
                          using recent developments in navigation, cartography, and maritime technology such as the caravel,
                          with the aim of finding a sea route to the source of the lucrative spice trade. In 1488, Bartolomeu Dias rounded
                          the Cape of Good Hope, and in 1498 Vasco da Gama reached India. In 1500, either by an accidental landfall or by the
                          crown's secret design, Pedro Álvares Cabral reached what would be Brazil.
                          <br><br>Over the following decades, Portuguese sailors continued to explore the coasts and islands of East Asia,
                          establishing forts and factories as they went. By 1571, a string of naval outposts connected Lisbon to Nagasaki
                          along the coasts of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. This commercial network and the colonial trade had a
                          substantial positive impact on Portuguese economic growth (1500–1800) when it accounted for about a fifth of
                          Portugal's per-capita income.

                          <strong>Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) - World strong super power</strong>
                           Christopher Columbus's 1492 discovery for Spain of the New World, which he believed to be Asia, led to disputes
                           between the Spanish and the Portuguese. These were eventually settled by the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494,
                           which divided the world outside of Europe in an exclusive duopoly between the Portuguese and the Spanish
                           along a north–south meridian 370 leagues, or 970 miles (1,560 km), west of the Cape Verde islands.
                           However, as it was not possible at the time to correctly measure longitude, the exact boundary was disputed
                           by the two countries until 1777.
