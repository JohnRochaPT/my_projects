| Design a webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to let users answer trivia questions.          |
|                                                                                                 |
| 1.- In index.html, add beneath “Part 1” a multiple-choice trivia question of your choosing with |
|     HTML.                                                                                       |
|                                                                                                 |
|   1.1.- You should use an h3 heading for the text of your question.                             |
|                                                                                                 |
|   1.2.- You should have one button for each of the possible answer choices. There should be at  |
|         least three answer choices, of which exactly one should be correct.                     |
|                                                                                                 |
| 2.- Using JavaScript, add logic so that the buttons change colors when a user clicks on them.   |
|                                                                                                 |
|   2.1.- If a user clicks on a button with an incorrect answer, the button should turn red and   |
|         text should appear beneath the question that says “Incorrect”.                          |
|                                                                                                 |
|   2.2.- If a user clicks on a button with the correct answer, the button should turn green and  |
|         text should appear beneath the question that says “Correct!”.                           |
|                                                                                                 |
| 3.- In index.html, add beneath “Part 2” a text-based free response question of your choosing    |
|     with HTML.                                                                                  |
|                                                                                                 |
|   3.1.- You should use an h3 heading for the text of your question.                             |
|                                                                                                 |
|   3.2.- You should use an input field to let the user type a response.                          |
|                                                                                                 |
|   3.3.- You should use a button to let the user confirm their answer.                           |
|                                                                                                 |
| 4.- Using JavaScript, add logic so that the text field changes color when a user confirms their |
|     answer.                                                                                     |
|                                                                                                 |
|   4.1.- If the user types an incorrect answer and presses the confirmation button, the text     |
|         field should turn red and text should appear beneath the question that says “Incorrect”.|
|                                                                                                 |
|   4.2.- If the user types the correct answer and presses the confirmation button, the input     |
|         field should turn green and text should appear beneath the question that says           |
|         “Correct!”.                                                                             |
|                                                                                                 |
| Optionally, you may also:                                                                       |
|                                                                                                 |
| 1.- Edit styles.css to change the CSS of your webpage!                                          |
|                                                                                                 |
| 2.- Add additional trivia questions to your trivia quiz if you would like!                      |
|                                                                                                 |
|                                                                                                 |
