//.*************************************************************************************************
//. User Story:
//.*************************************************************************************************
/// Imagine that you travel back in time to the 1970â€™s, when the C programming language was first
/// created. You are hired as a programmer to come up with a way to convert strings to ints. (You
/// may have used a function just like this in Week 2, called atoi). You want to be thorough in
/// your development process and plan to try several approaches before deciding on the most
/// efficient.
///
/// In this problem, you will start with a simple implementation of atoi that handles positive ints
/// using loops. You want to rework this into an implementation that uses recursion. Recursive
/// functions can be memory intensive and are not always the best solution, but there are some
/// problems in which using recursion can provide a simpler and more elegant solution.
///
/// (Scroll to the bottom of this page to see what an implementation of atoi might actually look
/// like.)
///


//.*************************************************************************************************
//. Requirements:
//.*************************************************************************************************
/// 1.- Start by getting the index of the last char in the string (the char before the \0).
///
/// 2.- Convert this char into its numeric value. Can you subtract some char to do this?
///
/// 3.- Remove the last char from the string by moving the null terminator one position to the left.
///
/// 4.- Return this value plus 10 times the integer value of the new shortened string.
///
/// 5.- Remember you need a base case when creating a recursive function.
